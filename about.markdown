# Welcome

My name is Joan Arnaldich. I am a software developer presently working
in Barcelona, Spain.

My main interest areas in computing non-imperative programming
paradigms, distributed & parallel computing, image processing, and, to
some extent, web development.

I am currently *not* looking for a job.
