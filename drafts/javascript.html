<h1 id="on-javascript">On JavaScript</h1>
<p>I remember playing around with JavaScript back in the times of Netscape Navigator. It wasn’t supposed to have a bright future back then (anyone remember Java Applets?), so after the first few WTFs (pick your favourites: <a href="http://wtfjs.com/">wtfjs</a>), I soon ran away in fear and never looked back at it for more than fifteen years.</p>
<p>Web programming has changed a lot since and, to the astonishment of many, JavaScript has become the most pervasive technology in this revolution. And while it is true that <a href="https://code.google.com/p/v8/">JavaScript implementations</a> have improved dramatically, all this explosion happened without the language itself getting any better.</p>
<p>For a hobby project of mine involving 3D programming for the web, I’ve been forced back to JavaScript, so I decided to look at it more closely. I happily found out that another area in which JavaScript has improved are learning materials. In particular, I found the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a> enlightening.</p>
<p>If you are planning to start some serious coding in JavaScript, please do not write a single line of code until you watch this video:</p>
<!-- <iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lP9-Zx_cCUg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->
<p>And, of course, getting a copy of the book is pretty much a must.</p>
<h2 id="scheme-in-disguise">Scheme in disguise</h2>
<p>One of the main points of the talk is Douglas’ epiphany that JavaScript was meant to be more like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> than like Java. As a long-term Scheme fan, this should have sort of cheered me up, but it didn’t… I can only take it as just another proof of how far people want to stay away from Lisp: they’d rather accept a half-baked, underspecified, implementation of a curly brace language than accept a mature language with an open standarization process and a whole lot more power just because its surface syntax looks funny.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, it is not just a matter of parentheses: <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> is a tiny language with an algol-like syntax that could serve the same purposes JavaScript was invented for, and that has efficient <a href="http://www.luajit.org">JIT compilation</a> and <a href="http://metalua.luaforge.net/">macros</a>. Oh! And it also gets <a href="http://www.lua.org/pil/16.1.html">prototype-based inheritance</a> right. Take this as a proof that we <em>could</em> have gotten a better JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="javascript-as-a-virtual-machine">JavaScript as a Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>Luckily, Javascript’s problems are well described, and the speed it gets in modern browsers make it possible to use it as a <em>target platform</em> for compilation.</p>
<p>Thus, a wealth of languages that compile down to Javascript have sprung in the past years. The range varies from those which just try to address its <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">syntactic quirks</a> to ones with <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">whole new semantics</a>. There are also versions of server-side languages compiled to javascript (<a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">clojure</a>, <a href="https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki">Haskell</a> has <a href="https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs">many</a> <a href="http://haste-lang.org/">options</a>), which in theory helps blurring the separation of tiers.</p>
<p>There is even an <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">LLVM backend</a>, so that C code can be run on your browser with no modifications…</p>
<p>Again, all these languages will not let you completely forget there is something called Javascript down there. In any respectable sized project you will indeed need some kind of Javascript FFI, and a good share of more or less ugly plumbing for integration.</p>
<h2 id="javascript-the-community">JavaScript, the Community</h2>
<p>And yet, it is hard not to get impressed by the utterly awesome open-source libraries and applications written in Javascript. The browser as a platform is one of the areas in computing that has most radically changed in the last years (along with GPUs and the Cloud), mainly due the V8 and HTML5.</p>
<p>And that is undoubtedly a merit of its community. There is one thing Javascript got right: the source is right there. You may minify it, obfuscate it or whatever, but the fact is that it is much easier to publish the code as-is than to disguise it, and this very fact fostered a culture of openness that empowered users and develpers as well. Commercial companies soon realized that the way to go was not taking pains to hide the source, but publishing their code as a way to demonstrate the quality of their code.</p>
<p>Take this as a proof of what the world would be like if open source was the rule, not the exception.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-sort-of">Conclusion (sort of)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We programmers are pretty good at making the most inconvenient technologies succeed.</li>
<li><strong>Never hire a JavaScript developer that does not know what a closure is.</strong></li>
