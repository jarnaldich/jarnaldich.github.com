# About page

My name is Joan Arnaldich. I am a software developer and team manager
presently working in Barcelona, Spain. By the way, Joan is a male
first name in my [mother tongue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language).

My main interest areas in computing are non-imperative programming
paradigms, distributed & parallel computing, image processing and
geographic information systems. I also have a soft spot for some
topics on applied maths (operations research, optimization,
statistics, machine learning ...).
